          This started out as a simple front end project for a family member who
          wanted a way to showcase their teaching qualifications and expertise
          in order to help expand their client base. We realised after a few
          meetings that what they were truly after a booking system on which
          they could update their availability and clients could request or
          cancel classes. Plans were then made to turn this into a full-stack
          project, and I am currently working on a draft for the back-end side
          of things.
